# Clustering-with-K-means (Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset)

customer clustering into 3 groups based on their income and spending

conclusion
- using elbow method, I understood that optimal K is 3
- setting k = 3, i got a cluster plot which denotes that clusters are well seperated
- got silloute score of 0.46, which is okay
